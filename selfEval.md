# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
I feel confident about these. They are pretty self-explanatory/make sense. 
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
Same for these. When it comes to getting these down it is a little more difficult because of the combos but after some practice I feel better about it.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
Great. Need more practice with not missing curly brackets, semicolon.
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
I spent about an hour an a half. It lines up with my estimate, I had given myself two hours. 
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I do need to practice from top to bottom because that's how I remember best. I need to add some time to my calendar this weekend to get it done. 
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
I know I'll run into some questions while practicing more. I have the resource links provided in the lessons ready in case.
